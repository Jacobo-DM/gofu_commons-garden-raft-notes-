## Knowledge Loop (v0.2): Inter-Garden Data Sharing + Ethical AI Assist

A core ethic of this commons is to **share learning across many gardens**, not just optimize one site. The goal is to reduce harm, speed up troubleshooting, and help local stewards learn from each other’s conditions.

This is not “complete.” It’s a living protocol that should be improved by others as local knowledge grows.

## What gets shared (minimum viable commons telemetry)
Share only what is useful for ecology and safety:

- water context: **fresh / brackish / salt** and **pond / river / bay / open water**
- temperature, pH, ammonia (TAN), nitrite, dissolved oxygen (if available)
- turbidity/clarity notes
- feed batch ID + processing path (heat/mill, ferment/dry, sprout/steam/dry)
- pellet integrity score (1–5)
- stocking density estimate + species (where allowed)
- events: storms, pump failure, net repair, unusual wildlife interactions
- outcomes: mortalities, growth class estimate, “what changed / what fixed it”

---

## Sharing rules (commons safety + privacy)
- **Local-first by default**: log locally even if connectivity fails.
- **Opt-in sharing**: publish only what you choose.
- **Anonymize location** unless a steward explicitly wants it public.
- Prefer **patterns over personal data**: conditions + responses + outcomes.

## Spoovel-to-Spoovel communication (AI-assisted, ethically constrained)
A future Spoovel pattern may include an “assistant” capability for:
- anomaly detection (“oxygen drop pattern,” “ammonia spike pattern”)
- real-time troubleshooting prompts (“stop feeding,” “increase aeration,” “check intake screen”)
- coordination with other gardens (“we’re seeing a bay-wide temperature swing—heads up”)

### Guardrails (non-negotiable)
- **No autopilot feeding** by default. Humans remain the stewards.
- If automation exists, it must be conservative, easily disabled, and fail-safe.
- **Transparency**: every recommendation should be explainable and logged (“why it suggested X”).
- **Security-first**: assume connectivity can be hostile; do not expose controls to the open internet.
- **Commons learning loop**: share outcomes (“we tried X—worked/didn’t”).

## Waterbody contexts: different worlds, different protocols
This project must evolve as a family of patterns, not one recipe.

### Freshwater garden (pond/lake)
- easier containment + monitoring
- eutrophication risk if nutrients escape
- simpler hardware can work, but runoff control matters

### River garden
- strong current variability
- debris/flood events dominate risk
- chemistry can swing fast after rain
- mooring + debris screening becomes essential

### Bay/estuary garden (brackish)
- salinity swings with tides and storms
- sediment/turbidity events
- high wildlife presence → entanglement prevention is critical
- biofouling is intense → plan maintenance

### Open water
- storm loads dominate design
- escape risk is highest
- access/maintenance becomes the limiting factor
- ecological stakes are high → strongest safeguards required

Commons stance: each environment should earn its own tested protocol set over time, contributed by local stewards.

## Ethical evolution: what we grow
Over time, the system may shift toward organisms and crops that reduce ecological pressure:
- edible sea vegetables / macroalgae (native/approved)
- mollusks as ecosystem-service organisms (food-safety testing if harvested)
- small forage fish concepts only with careful local ecological review

---

## Below–Above interface: letting sea life “interact” without harm
“Interaction” here means reciprocity, habitat, and witnessing—not extraction:
- a habitat curtain (native macroalgae line) separate from primary moorings
- reef-like shelter zones designed to avoid entanglement
- listening + sensing (hydrophone, temperature, turbidity) shared publicly as data/“ocean music”
- low-impact light cues only if proven non-disruptive (avoid bright/blue night lighting)

---

## Gofu storage below and fermentation gases (signal, not weapon)
If any fermentation is used, offgassing (often CO₂) should be treated primarily as:
- a **process signal** (healthy ferment vs spoilage)
- a **safety concern** (ventilation and monitoring)

Possible careful reuse:
- contained CO₂ enrichment for a small plant micro-zone (only if monitored and vented safely)
 
Avoid bubbling fermentation gases into water systems; CO₂ shifts pH and can stress organisms.
