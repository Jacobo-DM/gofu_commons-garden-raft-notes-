# The Garden Raft (Bridge)

This is a commons field practice bridging food resilience (Gofu) and repairable field tools (MythGear).

**Canonical notes + protocols + logs live in Gofu:**
- (link) ../gofu_commons/garden-raft-notes/  (local)
- (public) [paste your GitHub Pages link here once live]

## What MythGear contributes
- Logbook / CodeTape strips + waterproof labeling
- Simple bucket tests (pellet integrity + water clarity)
- Repairable pump + aeration mounts
- Sensor brackets (only after the biology is stable)

**Rule:** This page links. It does not duplicate the spec.
