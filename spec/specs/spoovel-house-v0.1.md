# The Spoovel House · v0.1
*A tending vessel for the Bloom.*

The **Spoovel House** is the **center node** of a six-petaled Bloom cluster: a shared hearth for repairs, spare parts, spoovels, stories, and the Elephant Circle.

This name is intentionally playful and open—other communities can rename it to what fits their place, culture, and lineage.

## Three verbs (muscle memory)
These are meant to be spoken, not explained.

- **Spoovel up** = bring your kit + your care  
- **Bloom up** = gather, tend, rejoice, regroup  
- **Seed out** = disperse with purpose, return with findings  

---

## What the Spoovel House is (and is not)

### It is:
- A **tending vessel**: tools, spares, repairs, care, learning, coordination
- A **commons**: shared resources + shared responsibility
- A **shelter**: for the delicate (seedlings, small creatures, shy students, fragile ideas)
- A **story-holding place**: where meaning stays attached to practice

### It is not:
- A panic siren
- A permanent formation
- A rigid command center

**Bloom is not alarm. Bloom is practice.**

---

## DiscoveryMode translation
When nodes “Bloom,” students experience it as **Elephant Circle**:
- coming together isn’t dread
- it’s *rhythm*
- a place where joy and hard times can both be held without posturing

The Spoovel House is the **MythHut / Medicine Hut / Hearth Node** of the Bloom:
- it teaches safety through repetition
- it makes tending feel normal
- it builds a culture where asking for help is strength

---

## Core functions (practical)
### 1) Repair + spares
- Patch materials, fasteners, line, clamps, sealants (context-appropriate)
- “Fix-it bench” mindset: mend before replace

### 2) Spoovel care (real + symbolic)
- Lost-and-found for field tools
- Sharpening, handle wraps, quick mends
- Shared kits: “borrow, return, improve”

### 3) Tending + ecology
- Gentle observation tools
- Nursery protocol (low impact, minimal handling, quick release)
- “Do no harm” guidelines posted plainly

### 4) Communication + learning
- Field notes, checklists, code tape / logging ritual
- A place to sync with other rafts/nodes (when applicable)

---

## Bloom / Seed relationship
The Spoovel House exists in both modes:

### Bloom Mode (center of the flower)
- accessible, visible, welcoming
- supports shared work + shared learning

### Seed Mode (dispersal)
- can detach first if it’s most vulnerable/high-value
- or can stay behind as a “safe anchor” depending on the hazard

Rule of thumb:
- **Force & contagion → Seed**
- **Care & coordination → Bloom**

---

## Roles (student-friendly)
- **Spoovel Keeper**: manages the tool commons and “borrow/return” culture
- **Tending Keeper**: leads care tasks (nursery, gentle observation, stewardship)
- **Line Tender**: checks soft connections, fenders, quick releases (if afloat)
- **Scribe**: logs repairs, observations, swaps, lessons learned
- **Watch**: scans conditions and calls for reassess (“Bloom still safe?”)

Roles rotate. No one “owns” the center.

---

## 30-second opening rite (optional)
Keep it simple. No theatrics required.

1. A single phrase: **“Spoovel up.”**
2. One shared breath.
3. One sentence: **“We Bloom to tend.”**
4. Begin the work.

(If kids roll their eyes, that’s fine. Consistency is the magic, not drama.)

## One-line definition (for README / signage)

This is a living page. Improve it by use.
A good Spoovel House leaves people feeling:
- steadier
- more capable
- more connected
- more willing to tend
