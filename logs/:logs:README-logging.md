# Logging (Commons Loop)

Minimum daily log (2 minutes):
- Date / time
- Fish behavior (normal / sluggish / surface gasping)
- Feed amount + batch ID (e.g., CowpeaGofu_v0.1)
- Water temp (if known)
- pH
- Ammonia & nitrite (strip tests ok)
- Any changes (filter cleaned, rainstorm, power dip)

Weekly log (10 minutes):
- Estimated growth / size class
- Mortalities (count + suspected cause)
- Pellet integrity score (1–5)
- Notes: what worked, what failed
