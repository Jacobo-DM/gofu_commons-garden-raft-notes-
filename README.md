## 1) What this is
A small-scale fish raft system that closes three loops:
1. Water loop (simple filtration + oxygen + circulation)
2. Energy loop (solar for pumps/sensors)
3. Protein loop (local beans → gofu processing → stable pellets → fish)

And a fourth “invisible” loop: the knowledge loop (shared logs so communities iterate faster).

## 2) The north-star idea
No soy monopoly. No “one crop to feed the world.”
**Gofu = a method:** any locally growable bean processed into a fish-usable feed.

The raft roof becomes a microfield:
- legumes climbing trellis + container planters
- solar canopy overhead
- fish below
- data shared outward

## 3) System at a glance
Minimum viable raft:
- 1 fish tank (or pen) + pump + mechanical filter + biofilter media + aeration
- basic test kits (ammonia/nitrite/pH)
- solar panel + charge controller + battery (optional but stabilizing)
- feeding protocol + logbook (paper or CodeTape)

Optional upgrades:
- dissolved oxygen sensor
- temperature sensor
- low-cost turbidity/clarity check
- auto-feeder (only after you trust pellet integrity + water stability)
