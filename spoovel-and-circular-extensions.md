## Extensions (v0.1): Spoovel Module · Circular Canopy · Habitat Layer

These are **optional extensions** to the Garden Raft Notes. They are written as commons-friendly patterns:
simple, testable, swappable, and always open to local adaptation.

This is not “complete.” It’s a living set of moves.

## 1) The Spoovel Module (v0.1)
**Spoovel = a swappable operations + resilience pod.**

Think of it as a portable “dockside tool + storm-mode kit” that can be mounted to the raft (or kept at the dock)
and swapped out quickly if damaged.

### What it helps with
- **Net construction & repair**
  - patching, stitching, tensioning, line work
- **Packaging of feed + batch labeling**
  - clean handling, storage, labeling, and traceability
- **Onboarding supplies/inputs**
  - a controlled “intake” point with checklists
- **Storm mode readiness**
  - winch/hoist support, spare lines, quick repairs
- **Emergency pump/power**
  - backup circulation, backup aeration, battery resilience
- **Swap-out resilience**
  - if the pod is damaged, replace the whole unit (don’t stop the project)

### Clean/Dirty rule (important)
To prevent cross-contamination and keep operations sane, the Spoovel should have two clear zones:

- **Clean zone**
  - feed packaging
  - batch ID labels
  - sealed containers / bins
  - clipboard / CodeTape logging

- **Dirty zone**
  - net repair tools
  - line/tension hardware
  - gloves, cutters
  - any solids-handling tools

If you only build one discipline into the project, build this one.

### Suggested contents (starter list)
**Tools**
- net needle/shuttle + twine
- repair mesh patch material
- tension straps + carabiners
- line cutter + spare rope
- gloves, headlamp

**Resilience**
- spare DC pump (and/or small air pump)
- tubing + airstone
- battery pack (or small deep-cycle) + basic fusing
- simple multimeter
- spare connectors + hose clamps

**Logging / traceability**
- printed checklist
- waterproof marker
- batch tags (QR or simple ID)
- clipboard or notebook + a “leave a trace” habit

### Interface standard (so it’s truly swappable)
- standard mounting points (same bolt pattern or strap points)
- standard hose diameters / quick-connects
- labeled power connectors (polarity marked)
- a “minimum viable Spoovel” spec so others can replicate

## 2) Circular + “Parabolic-ish” Canopy (v0.1)
A circular raft can distribute forces more evenly and reduce stress corners.
A shallow curved canopy shape can also reduce wind drag and collect rainwater.

### Why circular helps
- fewer “corner stress” points
- more even response to waves
- supports a calmer interior zone
- easier to implement a skirt/breakwater ring

### Canopy principle: flow-through reduces drag
Wind drag drops when air can pass through:
- leave gaps between panel rows
- avoid creating a single solid sail
- design for low wind profile in storms (“storm mode: panels down / locked”)

### “Parabolic-ish” as drainage geometry (not as a reflector)
The aim here is a **shallow bowl / funnel** shape for runoff, not a concentrating reflector.
A safe pattern is:
- standard solar panels mounted on rails above
- beneath them: a curved catch surface + gutters
- runoff → first-flush diverter → filter → storage

**Note:** treat collected rainwater as **irrigation water by default** unless you have appropriate testing/treatment.
Salt spray and bird fouling can contaminate catch surfaces.

## 3) Habitat Layer (v0.1): Native Kelp Curtain / Bio-Habitat Lines
The goal: increase ecological value and stability without increasing escape risk or wildlife hazard.

### Why this is promising
A habitat layer can:
- add complexity (shelter for small organisms)
- potentially uptake some dissolved nutrients
- invite “working ecosystem” behavior rather than monoculture vibes

### Guardrails (non-negotiable)
1) **Native-only** (or locally approved strains)
   - do not introduce non-native macroalgae
2) **Wildlife-safe geometry**
   - no loose loops
   - tensioned lines
   - clear spacing
   - no free-drifting fragments

### Recommended implementation: separate from primary mooring
Instead of seeding the primary anchor cables directly, use:
- a dedicated **kelp curtain / habitat line**
- separate anchors or attachment points
- tensioned and labeled
- designed for easy removal

### Storm mode for habitat layer
- “storm mode: detach or stow the habitat curtain”
- keep the primary mooring purely structural and predictable

## Commons reminder: this is a living pattern library
These extensions are offered as commons patterns, not prescriptions.
What belongs here over time:
- local species guidance and permissions
- failure notes and fixes
- better wildlife-safe hardware choices
- new low-tech solutions for circulation and storm-readiness

If you try any of this and learn something (especially if something fails), please **leave a trace** in the logs and notes.
