# Bloom/Seed Docking Protocol (Flower Cluster) · v0.1

A practical “flower” clustering pattern for modular rafts/nodes.
Inspired by a simple spice-tin geometry: **six outer cups (petals)** around **one central cup (tending vessel).**

This is a **behavior** (a mode you enter and leave), not a permanent structure.

---

## Core idea

### Bloom Mode (Cluster)
**Use when:** repair, preparation, teaching, caregiving, nursery/tidepool calm, resupply, collective watch.

**Formation:** 6 “petal nodes” loosely arranged around 1 central **Tending Vessel** node.

### Seed Mode (Disperse)
**Use when:** storms/high loads, fast current, human threat/harassment, contagion/pests, pollution plume.

**Formation:** nodes separate into pre-chosen safe zones while maintaining comms.

## Visual concept (top-down)

                 [P1]
          [P6]           [P2]

               (  TV  )
          [P5]           [P3]
                 [P4]

Legend:
- P1–P6 = Petal nodes (work/habitat/grow/power pods)
- TV    = Tending Vessel (commons hub)

Note: **“Loose bloom”** is preferred — spacing matters more than symmetry.
Keep a **central lagoon/pocket** for calmer water and safe movement.

---

## Safety principle

### Soft docking > rigid locking
Bloom Mode works best when connections are **flexible** and **sacrificial**.

**Avoid** hard structural links that transmit shock loads node-to-node.
Design for:
- **Fenders / bumpers**
- **Short bridles**
- **Quick-release**
- **Breakaway links** (connections that fail safely before the raft does)

---

## Trigger switch: Bloom or Seed?

### Choose BLOOM if the main need is…
- Repair / maintenance work
- Tool & parts sharing
- Teaching / observation / tidepool study
- Nursery protection (delicate plants/creatures)
- Collective watch in calm-to-moderate conditions

### Choose SEED if the main danger is…
- High wind / breaking waves / storm surge
- Strong current / tow loads
- Fire risk
- Disease/pests/invasive organisms
- Pollution slick / runoff plume
- Human threat (theft, harassment, targeting)

Rule of thumb:
- **Force & contagion → Seed**
- **Care & coordination → Bloom**

## Bloom Mode: setup steps (field-simple)

1. **Call Bloom**
   - Confirm conditions are within safe operating window.
   - Set a maximum duration (example: “Bloom for 6 hours, reassess.”)

2. **Establish perimeter line (“loom line”)**
   - A shared ring line helps maintain spacing without rigid structure.

3. **Position petals**
   - Place petal nodes around the ring line with consistent spacing.
   - Keep a **clear central lagoon** (no dangling lines, no nets).

4. **Dock the Tending Vessel**
   - TV sits in the middle OR slightly offset downwind/downcurrent (often safer).
   - TV should be low-profile and easy to extract.

5. **Connect with soft links**
   - Use short bridles, fenders, and quick-release points.
   - No single connection should be “mission critical.”

6. **Assign watch & comms**
   - Set a simple rotation.
   - Confirm mesh/LoRa/Wi-Fi and “lost comms” fallback.

7. **Work window**
   - Repairs, tending, teaching, swaps.
   - Keep lanes clear for emergency undocking.

---

## Seed Mode: dispersal steps (field-simple)

1. **Call Seed**
   - Short, unambiguous command: “SEED NOW.”
   - TV leaves first if it is the highest-value / most vulnerable node.

2. **Breakaway sequence**
   - Release in a planned order (outermost first, or TV first depending on hazard).
   - Never “fight” a jammed line—cut if needed.

3. **Rally protocol**
   - Each node heads to a pre-chosen safe zone.
   - If comms fail: “Regroup at Waypoint A at dawn.”

---

## Roles (simple, teachable)

- **Tending Keeper (TV lead):** tools, parts, triage, comms relay, decision switch Bloom/Seed
- **Petal Stewards (P1–P6):** each owns a function (power, habitat, grow, filtration, classroom, storage)
- **Line Tender:** manages loom line, fenders, quick-release checks
- **Watch Lead:** situational scan, weather/current check, human traffic awareness
- **Scribe / Logger:** notes repairs, observations, swaps, incidents (for learning)

## Tending Vessel loadout (starter checklist)

### Repair & sealing
- Assorted cordage + spare line
- Zip ties (various sizes)
- Hose clamps
- Patch materials (fabric + adhesive appropriate for wet use)
- Marine-safe sealant / epoxy (as appropriate)
- Spare fasteners (nuts/bolts/screws), washers
- Utility knife + spare blades
- Multi-tool + basic hand tools (wrench, pliers, screwdriver)

### Safety
- First aid kit + emergency blanket
- Gloves (work + nitrile)
- Headlamp
- Whistle + signaling light
- Knife/line cutter accessible (not buried)

### Water/eco monitoring (minimal)
- Thermometer
- Salinity refractometer or basic strip tool (if relevant)
- pH test strips
- Simple turbidity tube (DIY-friendly)
- Sample jars + labels

### Comms & power
- Mesh node / LoRa radio (if used)
- Battery bank + charging cables
- Waterproof notebook or “code tape” logs
- Printed protocol card (this page condensed)

### Teaching / tending (optional)
- Small magnifier
- Tweezers
- Soft brush
- Observation tray
- “No harm” handling guidelines card

## Connection hardware notes (practical)

Recommended:
- Quick-release shackles or carabiners (rated appropriately)
- Sacrificial “weak link” segments (designed to fail first)
- Fenders / bumpers between hulls
- Short bridles with some elasticity

Avoid:
- Long taut lines under high tension
- Rigid bridges that transmit shock loads
- Nets/lines hanging in the central lagoon during Bloom

---

## After-action (learning loop)

After each Bloom/Seed event, log:
- Why we chose Bloom/Seed
- Conditions (wind/current/visibility/human traffic)
- What failed / what worked
- Repairs made + parts used
- Ecological observations (if any)
- Improvements for next time

## Notes

This is a living protocol.
Upgrade it as you learn: better breakaways, clearer roles, safer thresholds.

Memory anchor:
**“Bloom to care. Seed to survive.”**
