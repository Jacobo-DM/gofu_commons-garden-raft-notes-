many beans
A raft-scale fish system that closes loops—then publishes the learning.
This is a commons offering, not a commercial product. Use, remix, adapt, and share improvements—especially what fails (that’s where the real learning lives).

North-star
No soy monopoly. Gofu = a method: any locally growable bean processed into a fish-usable feed.
The invisible loop
Shared logs so communities iterate faster — paper-first is fine.
What this is
The Garden Raft is a small, sustainable, open-source aquaculture notebook: a solar-powered salt/brackish raft system that turns locally grown beans (“gofu” as method) into stable fish feed — and shares the results so others can adapt it.
At a glance
	•	Water loop: filtration + oxygen + circulation
	•	Energy loop: solar for pumps/sensors
	•	Protein loop: beans → gofu processing → pellets → fish
	•	Knowledge loop: shared logs and failures
Loop A — Water loop
Goal: stable oxygen + low ammonia + low nitrite.
	•	Pump intake screen
	•	Mechanical solids filter (swirl / sock / settle)
	•	Biofilter media (nitrifying bacteria home)
	•	Aeration (stone/venturi)
	•	Return flow back to tank/pen
Rule: If water clouds or fish gasp → reduce feeding first, then troubleshoot.

Loop B — Energy loop
Goal: pumps + sensors don’t die when the sun blinks.
	•	Solar panel sized to your pump draw
	•	Charge controller
	•	Direct DC pump if possible
	•	Battery optional but stabilizing
Loop C — Protein loop (Beans → Gofu → Pellets → Fish)
Fish generally should not be fed raw legumes. Many beans contain anti-nutritional factors that can reduce digestibility, irritate guts, and foul water fast (clouding → ammonia → oxygen crash).
Pellet rule (non-negotiable)
Pellets must hold together in water long enough to be eaten. If pellets crumble: you are feeding the water, not the fish.
Starter “Gofu Pellet” template (test batch)
• 60–75% processed bean meal
• 10–25% cooked starch binder (rice/tapioca/cassava)
• 5–10% oil/fat source (small amount)
• optional mineral/vitamin premix (recommended if replacing commercial feed)

Start with omnivores first. Conservative feeding beats heroic feeding.
Knowledge loop — Logging
Daily (2 minutes): behavior, feed amount + batch ID, pH, ammonia, nitrite, changes.
Weekly (10 minutes): growth notes, mortalities, pellet integrity score (1–5), what worked/failed.

Safety rails (the “don’t die” list)
Red flags
	•	Fish at surface gulping
	•	Sudden cloudiness
	•	Sharp smell
	•	Rising ammonia/nitrite
Immediate actions
	1	Stop/reduce feeding
	2	Increase aeration
	3	Check pump + filter
	4	Partial water change if needed (species-dependent)
