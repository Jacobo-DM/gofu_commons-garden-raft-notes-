## Roof Microfield (v0.1): Terrace Notes for “Three Sisters” on a Raft

This is a **test-first** pattern for growing a “roof microfield” (e.g., Three Sisters) on a floating platform.
It borrows terrace-garden principles: low profile, layered wind protection, controlled runoff, and modular beds.

This is a commons experiment, not a promise. We expect iteration.

## North-star stance
Yes, “Three Sisters” *can* work on a raft—**if** we treat the roof like a terrace garden on a moving platform.
The constraints are less about botany and more about:
- wind loading
- salt spray
- weight distribution (top-heavy sway)
- drainage and nutrient runoff control

---

## Design principles (terrace mode)
### 1) Low profile first
Start with **low, terraced beds**. Avoid tall trellises until the platform proves stable.

### 2) Wind protection as a roof “edge ecology”
- Put the most salt/wind-tolerant plants at the perimeter.
- Place more sensitive plants toward the interior.
- Use low mesh baffles / screens / skirts rather than creating a sail.

### 3) Salt spray strategy (non-negotiable)
- Assume salt spray is real.
- Favor varieties with higher tolerance near edges.
- If rain catch is available, use occasional **freshwater rinsing** (as needed).
- Do not assume harvested rainwater is potable; treat as irrigation unless tested/treated.

### 4) Weight discipline
- Use **lightweight media** (avoid heavy soil).
- Think: coco coir + compost + biochar blends (local variation allowed).
- Design beds as **modular trays** that can be removed/swapped.

### 5) Closed-loop runoff (protect surrounding marine life)
Every bed must manage runoff.
- Do not allow nutrient-rich drainage to dump directly into surrounding water.
- Use capture trays, overflow routing, and/or return-to-compost pathways.

## What makes the “Three Sisters” tricky on a raft
- Corn can act like a wind sail (torsion + uplift + snapping).
- Tall growth increases sway/top-heaviness.
- Salt scorch can damage leaves quickly.
- Water slosh and uneven irrigation can stress roots.
- A roof garden can become a pest attractor (“floating buffet”).

None of this is a “no.” It just means: **phase it**.

---

## Recommended testing ladder (tiny → bigger)
### Phase A: “Two Sisters” first (low profile)
- squash + beans on low frames
- no corn yet
Goal: prove irrigation, drainage, and wind handling.

### Phase B: Add a corn analog before corn
- trial a shorter “stalk” crop first (e.g., millet/sorghum depending on locale)
Goal: evaluate wind load without the full sail effect.

### Phase C: True corn (only after stability is proven)
- small patch, protected interior zone
- backup plan for wind events (“storm mode: prune/secure/remove”)

---

## Roof bed layout suggestion (v0.1)
- Perimeter ring: hardy, wind-tolerant species + low wind baffles
- Mid ring: main beds (squash/beans)
- Inner zone: experimental corn / taller plants (later phases)
- Clear access lanes for maintenance (don’t trap workers on a slick roof)

---

## Minimum viability checklist (before scaling)
- Roof can handle weight without dangerous sway
- Beds have runoff capture and controlled overflow
- Wind baffles reduce uplift (no “sail” behavior)
- Salt spray is accounted for in planting and maintenance
- “Storm mode” exists for roof beds (secure, prune, remove, or lock down)

---

## Commons reminder: leave a trace
When you test:
- record conditions (wind, spray, rain)
- record media mix and irrigation method
- record what failed and what held
- publish the iteration (this is the knowledge loop)
